Fiji Cloud Webmail
==================

Fiji Cloud Webmail is a beautiful open source webmail client supporting the latest IMAP4 protocol. 
It features integration with Joomla through the Fiji Cloud Email hosting service but can be used with any Email Server supporting IMAP.

When integrated with Joomla the users of the Joomla website automatically have an email account on the email server and only need to log into Joomla to be logged into the Fiji Cloud Webmail. This level of integration between email and a CMS is a first of it's kind.

We are also developing integration with Drupal and Wordpress.
